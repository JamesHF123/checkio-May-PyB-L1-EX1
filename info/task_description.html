    <h1>Strings and Variables</h1>

</p>
<p> In this lesson we are going to learn about strings and variables. A bit of sample code has been created that already works.
The computer will ask you what your name is and then it will print out Hello and your first name.
For example if your name was Pikachu the computer would say hello Pikachu</p>

<!-- Explain input and output values -->
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments. Both are ints.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> Int. 
</p>


<!-- Give some usage examples -->
<div class="for_info_only">
    <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>

{% if is_js %}
<pre class="brush: javascript">sumTwo(3, 2) == 5
sumTwo(5, 7) == 12
</pre>
{% else %}
<pre class="brush: python">
name("Bob") == "Hello Bob"
name("Pikachu" == "Hello Pikachu"
</pre>
{% endif %}
</div>


<!-- Here you can explain how it can be used in development -->
<!-- The section is optional -->
<p class="for_info_only">

    <strong>How itâ€™s used: </strong>
    <i>This is a very common useage in coding. We are allowing the computer to add prebuilt expressions (words) to inputs we type in. Allowing us to use the computer to automate tasks.</i>
</p>

<!-- Here you can explain some constraints for input-->
<!-- The section is optional -->
<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong>
    <i>The input command assumes everything we type in is a string so even numbers will work give 12 a try</i>
</p>
